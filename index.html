                    A potential superpower is a state or a political and economic entity that is speculated to be , or to be in the process of becoming, a superpower at some point in the 21st century. Presently, it is widely considered that only the United States currently fulfills the criteria to be considered a superpower. States most commonly mentioned as being potential superpowers are Brazil, China, the European Union (a supranational entity),<SPAN class="highlight">India</SPAN> and Russia, based on a variety of factors.<br>
                    Several media publications and academics have discussed the Republic of   becoming a superpower.<b>Is India really shining?Is it really on the path of becoming a superpower?</b> Optimistic Indians would assert an affirmation but it is time one had a reality check India is surely marching ahead, but are all the Indians marching ahead or is it just a small fraction of the population doing so? India can surely boast of a growth rate of around 8-9 per cent, but one needs to ask if this growth is trickling down to the lower strata of the populace.<br>
                    Sixty three years ago in 1947 when India got independence , the question then asked was ‘ will India survive’? today, India’s economic profile has changed. At over a trillion dollars, it is a force to reckon with not just in Asia but in the entire world. With its new currency symbol to be internationalized soon, India now flexes its financial muscle.<br>
                    Soon after independence our nation was in turmoil. Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, tragic partition rendering millions of people homeless tribal invasion in J&K coupled with problem of consolidation of five hundred princely states, to build a new nation was a mammoth task. <i><b><span class="highlight">After going through different phases of lows and highs, the doubtful query ‘will India survive’ has been replaced by more hopeful query, will India become a superpower?</span></i></b><br>

                <p>INDIA'S HISTORY & GEOGRAPHY
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="hist">
                <h2>HISTORY:</h2>
                <P>India's earliest settlements are believed to have developed in the culture hearths of the Indus Valley around 2600 BCE and in the Ganges Valley around 1500 BCE.
                <br>Aryan tribes are believed to have then invaded the area after they migrated into the Indian subcontinent from the northwest. It is thought that they introduced the caste system, which is still common in many parts of India today. During the fourth century BCE, Alexander the Great introduced Greek practices into the region when he expanded across Central Asia. During the third century BCE, the Mauryan Empire came into power in India and was most successful under its emperor, Ashoka.Throughout subsequent periods Arab, Turkish and Mongol peoples entered India and in 1526, a Mongol Empire was established there, which later expanded throughout most of northern India. During this time, such landmarks as the Taj Mahal were also constructed.<br>
                Much of India's history after the 1500s was dominated by British influences. The first British colony was established in 1619 by the English East India Company at Surat. Shortly thereafter, permanent trading stations opened in present-day Chennai, Mumbai, and Kolkata. British influence then continued to expand from these initial trading stations and by the 1850s, most of India and other countries such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh were controlled by Britain. Queen Victoria of England took the title of Empress of India in 1876.<br>
                By the late 1800s, India began a long struggle working toward independence from Britain. That finally happened in the 1940s, when Indian citizens began to unite and British Labor Prime Minister Clement Attlee (1883–1967) began to push for India's independence. On August 15, 1947, India officially became a dominion within the Commonwealth and Jawaharlal Nehru (1889–1964) was named India's Prime Minister. India's first constitution was written shortly thereafter on January 26, 1950, and at that time, it officially became a member of the British Commonwealth.<br>
                Since gaining its independence, India has undergone significant growth in terms of its population and economy, however, there have been periods of instability in the country and much of its population today lives extreme poverty.</p>
                <h2>GEOGRAPHY :</h2>
                <p>The geography of India is diverse and can be divided into three main regions. The first is the rugged, mountainous Himalayan region in the northern part of the country, while the second is called the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It is in this region that most of India's large-scale agriculture takes place. The third geographic region in India is the plateau region in the southern and central portions of the country. India also has three major river systems, all of which have large deltas that take over a large portion of the land. These are the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra Rivers.<br>
                India's climate is also varied but is tropical in the south and mainly temperate in the north. The country also has a pronounced monsoon season from June to September in its southern portion.<br>
                Hindi and English are India's official languages, but there are also 17 regional languages that are considered official.<br>
                India has several cities that have undergone place name changes such as Bombay being renamed Mumbai. These changes were mainly done in an effort to return the city names to local dialects, as opposed to British translations.</p>
